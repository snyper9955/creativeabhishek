      <p>
        Hey, I'm <strong>Abhishek</strong> — a passionate <span className="highlight">video editor</span> and 
        <span className="highlight"> graphic designer</span> from Darbhanga, Bihar. 
        I specialize in editing vlogs, creating motion graphics, and designing impactful content for YouTube.
      </p>
      <p>
        With experience in tools like <strong>Adobe Premiere Pro</strong>, 
        <strong> After Effects</strong>, and <strong>DaVinci Resolve</strong>, I bring stories to life through visuals.
        I'm also building a platform to teach video editing, sell digital products, and help others grow with creative skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it's creating fast-paced trailer shorts, skill-based content, or sleek login UIs — 
        I focus on both aesthetics and impact.
